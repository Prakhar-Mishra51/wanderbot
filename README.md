# WanderBot

The purpose of this  project was to develop a robotics system using ROS (Robotic Operating System) to control a Turtlebot robot. WanderBot is a program that causes the robot to avoid obstacles and randomly wander around its environment.

This project was started with the reference of "ROS Robot Programming Practice".some of the modifications done was the addition of a state-of-the-art-2D navigation system in the robot. We drive the  Turtlebot by publishing a stream of Twist  messages.
